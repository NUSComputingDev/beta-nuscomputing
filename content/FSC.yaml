  - Long ago, the five races lived together in harmony.
    Then everything changed when Valentine attacked.
    Only the God of War, wielder of the 5 mortal instruments could stop her.
    But once he defeated her, he vanished, leaving each race with one mortal instrument.
    Unable to determine the origin of Valentine, the 5 races began blaming one
    another and went their separate ways.
  - Freshmen Social Camp is COMING BACK after a 1 year hiatus!
    Because of the attack of Ms Rona on the world, we are going hybridâ€” enjoy
    two days of both online & physical interaction with your peers!
  - What are you waiting for? Join the first & littest SUMMER camp
    brought to you by the School of Computing (SoC), and get a headstart in forging everlasting friendships!"
