        <Typography variant='body1'>
          Established when NUS School of Computing gained independence as a separate faculty in 1998,
            the NUS Students’ Computing Club is the official faculty club and sole union representative
            of all undergraduates in NUS School of Computing. The club has since been taking care of the
            student life in NUS School of Computing by organising various events and activities to
            promote campus vibrancy. We safeguard the interest of our undergraduates, ensure their
            voices are heard, provide welfare, and form the bridge between our students and the school.
